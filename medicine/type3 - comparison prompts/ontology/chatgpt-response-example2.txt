To answer the question, we need to count the number of main steps in each procedure without considering the substeps or subtasks.

From Context1 (2-Cylinder Portable System Assembly):

1. Mounting the flowmeter to the manifold (ex:MountFlowmeter)
2. Attaching hoses to the flowmeter (ex:AttachHoses)
3. Verifying flowmeter operations (ex:VerifyFlowmeterOperation)

Total main steps in Context1: 3

From Context2 (Installation of FM Type):

1. Pole Assembly Installation (ex:PoleAssemblyPlan)
2. Control Box Mounting Plate (ex:ControlBoxMountingPlan)
3. Arm Assembly Installation (ex:ArmAssemblyPlan)
4. Head Installation (ex:HeadInstallationPlan)
5. Control Box Installation (ex:ControlBoxInstallationPlan)
6. Adjustment (ex:AdjustmentPlan)

Total main steps in Context2: 6

Answer: The "Installation of FM Type" procedure (from Context2) has more steps than the "2-Cylinder Portable System Assembly" procedure (from Context1).
