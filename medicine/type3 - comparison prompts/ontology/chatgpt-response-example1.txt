To answer the question, let's count the number of main steps in each procedure based on the provided RDF graphs (Context1 and Context2).
Context1: "2-Cylinder Portable System Assembly" Procedure

1. Mounting the flowmeter to the manifold (ex:MountFlowmeter)
2. Attaching hoses to the flowmeter (ex:AttachHoses)
3. Subplan for Connecting gas cylinders (ex:ConnectGasCylindersSubPlan) - Not counting substeps
4. Verifying flowmeter operations (ex:VerifyFlowmeterOperation)

Total main steps in Context1: 4
Context2: "Changing Gas Cylinders" Procedure

1. Open the tank enclosure by sliding the cover to the rear (ex:CylinderStep1)
2. Close the valve on the empty tank (clockwise) (ex:CylinderStep2)
3. Release the Velcro restraint on the empty tank (ex:CylinderStep3)
4. Tilt the empty tank out slightly (ex:CylinderStep4)
5. Loosen the round handle on the regulator yoke (ex:CylinderStep5)
6. Remove the regulator from the empty tank (ex:CylinderStep6)
7. Lay the empty cylinder down on the floor (ex:CylinderStep7)
8. Pick up the full replacement tank (ex:CylinderStep8)
9. Check to assure that the sealing gasket has remained on the regulatorâ€™s E yoke (ex:CylinderStep9)
10. Reattach the regulator to the new full tank (ex:CylinderStep10)
11. Tighten the round handle on the regulator yoke (ex:CylinderStep11)
12. Push the tank into an upright position. Attach and tighten the Velcro tank restraint (ex:CylinderStep12)

Total main steps in Context2: 12
Answer:

The "Changing Gas Cylinders" procedure (Context2) has more main steps (12) compared to the "2-Cylinder Portable System Assembly" procedure (Context1), which has 4 main steps.
