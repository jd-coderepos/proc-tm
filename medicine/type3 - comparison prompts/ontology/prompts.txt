//the tests can be performed with generated graphs as well as with gold-standard graph

EXAMPLE 1 PROMPT

Refer to the following RDF graph as Context1.

#copy-paste the "2-Cylinder Portable System Assembly" RDF graph generated previously in template 1 of example1

Now refer to the following RDF graph as Context2.
