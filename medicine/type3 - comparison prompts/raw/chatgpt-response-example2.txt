2. Attach the hoses to the flowmeter.
3. Connect the gas cylinders to the manifold’s “E” yokes.
4. Open and close tanks.
5. Verify flowmeter operations.

Total main steps for Context1: 5

Context2 (Installation of FM Type):

1. POLE ASSEMBLY INSTALLATION
2. CONTROL BOX MOUNTING PLATE
3. ARM ASSEMBLY INSTALLATION
4. HEAD INSTALLATION
5. CONTROL BOX INSTALLATION
