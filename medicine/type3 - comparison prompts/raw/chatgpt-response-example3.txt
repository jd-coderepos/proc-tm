To determine which procedure has more steps without considering substeps or subtasks, let's count the main steps in each context:

Context1 (Changing Gas Cylinders procedure):

1. Open the tank enclosure by sliding the cover to the rear.
2. Close the valve on the empty tank (clockwise).
3. Release the Velcro restraint on the empty tank.
4. Tilt the empty tank out slightly.
5. Loosen the round handle on the regulator yoke.
6. Remove the regulator from the empty tank.
7. Lay the empty cylinder down on the floor.
8. Pick up the full replacement tank and place the bottom of the tank onto the floor of the Newport, leaving it slightly tilted outward for easy replacement of the regulator.
9. Check to assure that the sealing gasket has remained on the regulatorâ€™s E yoke.
10. Reattach the regulator to the new full tank by sliding the yoke (attached to the regulator) over the top of the tank post aligning the index pins with the corresponding holes in the tank post.
11. Tighten the round handle on the regulator yoke.
12. Push the tank into an upright position. Attach and tighten the Velcro tank restraint.

Total main steps for Context1: 12

Context2 (Installation of FM Type procedure):

1. POLE ASSEMBLY INSTALLATION (Referenced in FIGURE 17)
2. CONTROL BOX MOUNTING PLATE (Referenced in FIGURE 18)
3. ARM ASSEMBLY INSTALLATION
4. HEAD INSTALLATION: Refer to page 16 of the document.
5. CONTROL BOX INSTALLATION: Refer to page 17 of the document.
6. ADJUSTMENT

Total main steps for Context2: 6

Answer: The "Changing Gas Cylinders" procedure (Context1) has more steps than the "Installation of FM Type" procedure (Context2). Specifically, Context1 has 12 main steps, while Context2 has 6 main steps.
