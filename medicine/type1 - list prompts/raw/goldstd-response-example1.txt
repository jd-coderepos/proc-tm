1. Mount the flowmeter to the portable manifold: 
	a. Remove hole cap from the upper hole (use sharp edge knife or screwdriver) at rear of manifold and release set screw (use 5/32" Allen Wrench) enough to remove flowmeter mount. 
	b. Remove protective cap from threads of mount and remove from manifold. Thread flowmeter mount into hole on the bottom of flowmeter by hand and tighten firmly using 5/32" Allen Wrench placed in hole on side of flowmeter mount. 
	c. Place flowmeter on manifold with mount in pocket. 
	d. Tighten set screw firmly from rear while keeping flowmeter oriented toward front of manifold. 
	e. Place hole cap into hole behind the set screw and push it all way in.
2. Attach the hoses to the flowmeter: 
	a. Run the nitrous oxide hose under the manifold and attach it to the nitrous oxide DISS fitting located on the back of the flowmeter. 
	b. Run the oxygen hose under the manifold and attach it to the oxygen DISS fitting located on the back of the flowmeter.  
Note: To avoid gas leaks, make certain all hose attachments are securely tightened.
3. Connect the gas cylinders to the manifold's "E" yokes: 
	a. Connect the nitrous oxide gas cylinders to the "E" yoke on the N2O side 
	b. Connect the oxygen gas cylinders to the "E" yoke on the O2 side. 
	c. It is recommended to use new gasket every time tank is replaced or removed.
4. (Keep wrench in handy location. It is used to open and close tanks). 
	a. Open both gas cylinders and turn off flowmeter. 
	b. Check hose connections for leaks using soap solution. 
	c. Tighten fittings as needed to stop leaks.
5. Verify flowmeter operations.
Note: See page 23 for attaching rubber goods, including scavenging circuit.
