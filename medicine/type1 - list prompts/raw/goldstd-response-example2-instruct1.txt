Managing Gas Supply  
1. Identify the two in-use tanks (N2O and O2) by attaching "in-use" identification tags to them. 
2. When one of the in-use tanks is empty, close the tank by turning the valve clockwise. Leave the empty tank in place. 
3. Move the "in-use" tag to the appropriate reserve tank, which now becomes the in-use tank. Replace the empty tank with a new tank, which then becomes the reserve tank. 
4. Open the valve of the new in-use tank by turning counterclockwise.  
   Note: Do not open the reserve tank until the in-use tank is empty. When changing gas tanks, make certain both same gas cylinders that are involved in the exchange are closed. Always remember to switch the "in-use" tags over to the new tanks.  
5. Contact gas supplier to request new gas cylinders as needed.
