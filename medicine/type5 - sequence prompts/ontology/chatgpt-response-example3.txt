Based on the provided RDF graph for the "Installation of FM Type" procedure, Step 1 corresponds to the ex:PoleAssemblyPlan. To identify the next step after this, we need to look for the subplan that is decomposed as a plan after the ex:PoleAssemblyPlan.

From the RDF graph:
ex:PoleAssemblyPlan has the property kh-p:isDecomposedAsPlan ex:ControlBoxMountingPlan, which means that after the "Pole Assembly Installation" step, the next step is represented by the ex:ControlBoxMountingPlan.

ex:ControlBoxMountingPlan corresponds to the "Control Box Mounting Plate" step.

Answer: The next step after Step 1 ("Pole Assembly Installation") in the "Installation of FM Type" procedure is "Control Box Mounting Plate".
