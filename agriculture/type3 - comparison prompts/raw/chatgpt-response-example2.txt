Let's break down the main steps for each context:

Context1 (Operating the Hydrostatic Transmission):

1. Start machine engine.
2. Choose speed range with range shift lever (A) to match work application.
3. Depress brake pedal.
4. Unlock park brake.
5. Release brake pedal.
6. Move throttle lever (B) forward until the engine operates at the desired speed.
7. Travel Direction.
8. Stop machine to change speed range.
   (Using Cruise Control is specific to model 1026R and has its own substeps, so we won't count it as a main step.)

Total main steps for Context1: 8

Context2 (Changing Front Axle Oil):
