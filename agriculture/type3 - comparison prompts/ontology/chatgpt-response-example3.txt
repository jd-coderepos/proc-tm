To determine which procedure has more steps, we need to count the main steps in each procedure:

Context1 (Lowering ROPS Crossbar procedure):

1. Remove spring locking pin and drilled pin on each side of the ROPS.
2. Carefully lower ROPS crossbar about half way down.
3. Install drilled pins and spring locking pins and lower crossbar onto drilled pins.

Total steps in Context1: 3

Context2 (Changing Front Axle Oil procedure):

1. Operate machine to warm front axle oil.
2. Park machine safely.
3. Position drain pan under differential drain plug (A).
4. Remove differential drain plug and allow oil to drain.
5. Position drain pan under each front axle drain plug (B).
6. Remove both drain plugs and allow oil to drain.
7. Install and tighten both drain plugs after all oil has drained.
8. Remove dipstick (C) located on right side of front axle and vent plug (D).
9. Add approximately 2.8 L (3.0 qt) of recommended oil through dipstick fill opening until oil level is correct.
10. Install and tighten dipstick.
11. Check front axle oil level.

Total steps in Context2: 11

Answer: The "Changing Front Axle Oil" procedure (from Context2) has more steps than the "Lowering ROPS Crossbar" procedure (from Context1).
