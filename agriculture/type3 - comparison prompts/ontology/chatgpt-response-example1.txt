To answer the question, we need to count the number of main steps in each procedure from both contexts.

From Context1 (Operating the Hydrostatic Transmission procedure):

1. Start machine engine.
2. Choose speed range with range shift lever to match work application.
3. Depress brake pedal.
4. Unlock park brake.
5. Release brake pedal.
6. Move throttle lever forward until engine operates at desired speed.
7. Slowly depress pedal to travel forward or in reverse.
8. Stop machine to change speed range.
9. Using Cruise Control (This is a sub-procedure, so we won't count its steps).

Total main steps in Context1: 8

From Context2 (Lowering ROPS Crossbar procedure):

1. Remove spring locking pin and drilled pin on each side of the ROPS.
2. Carefully lower ROPS crossbar about half way down.
3. Install drilled pins and spring locking pins and lower crossbar onto drilled pins.

Total main steps in Context2: 3

Answer: The "Operating the Hydrostatic Transmission" procedure (from Context1) has more steps than the "Lowering ROPS Crossbar" procedure (from Context2).
