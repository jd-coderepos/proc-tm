Based on the provided Context, the steps for "Operating the Hydrostatic Transmission" procedure are as follows:

1. Start machine engine.
2. Choose speed range with range shift lever (A) to match work application.
	- L – Low speed operations such as tilling hard soil, mowing long grass, or heavy hauling. In this mode, machine speed is decreased, but machine power is increased.
	- N – Neutral position. Lever must be in the N (neutral) position when starting the engine.
	- H – High speed operations such as light tilling and hauling, mowing short grass, and transport. In this mode, machine speed is increased, but machine power is decreased.
3. Depress brake pedal.
4. Unlock park brake.
5. Release brake pedal.
6. Move throttle lever (B) forward until the engine operates at the desired speed.
	- Note: When the travel pedal is released, the transmission will automatically return to neutral.
7. Travel Direction:
	- To travel forward: Slowly depress pedal (C) downward.
	- To travel in reverse: Slowly depress pedal (D) downward.
		> The farther either travel pedal is depressed, the faster the machine will travel.
8. Stop machine to change speed range.

Using Cruise Control (specific to model 1026R):
- Note: The cruise control is only operational when the machine is traveling forward.
8.1 Engaging Cruise Control:
	- Depress forward travel pedal until the desired travel speed is reached.
	- Lift cruise control lever (A) to engage.
	- Release forward travel pedal.
8.2 Disengaging Cruise Control: The cruise control can be disengaged in one of two ways:
	- Depress brake pedal and push cruise control lever down.
	- Increase travel speed slightly and push cruise control lever down.
8.3 Adjusting Cruise Control Travel Speed:
	- To increase travel speed: Press the forward travel pedal until the desired speed is reached.
	- To decrease travel speed: Disengage cruise control, adjust forward travel speed as desired, and engage the cruise control lever.

* Important Caution: To prevent transmission damage, stop machine motion completely before shifting the range shift lever.
* Safety Caution: Use cruise control only in large, open areas. Shut off before turning or when in areas with many obstacles.
