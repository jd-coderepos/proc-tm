2. Loosen and remove the dipstick (A) located on the right side of the front axle.
3. Wipe the dipstick clean with a rag. Install dipstick but do not tighten. Allow dipstick to rest on top of threads.

	a. Add recommended oil through dipstick fill opening until oil level is correct.
	b. Install and tighten dipstick.
5. Check front axle oil level again after the first several hours of operation.
