Refer to the uploaded document content as Context and please provide an Answer to the Question below. 

Question: Can you generate an instantiated RDF graph to the provided Ontology using data in the Context which refers to the 'Operating the Hydrostatic Transmission' procedure with the help of implicit classes subplans and substeps of the Ontology?
Answer:

note: if ChatGPT generates only a graph of steps, it should be prodded further before arrving at the final answer "Why haven't you used the substep and subplan implicit classes. Try again."
