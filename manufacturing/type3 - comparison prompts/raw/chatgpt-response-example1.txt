Let's break down the steps for each context:

Context1 (Inspect the pump procedure):

1. Remove the plastic shipping plugs from the vent holes in the head column and the casing.
2. Remove all the equipment from the shipping containers.
3. Completely clean the underside of the support plate and both sides of the optional pit cover, if supplied.
4. Remove any grease from the machined surfaces.

Total main steps for Context1: 4

Context2 (Support plate installation procedure):
For "Support plate installation with a pit cover":

1. Carefully lower the pit cover onto the foundation bolts.
2. Use as long a level as possible in order to level the pit cover in all directions with shims or wedges.
3. Hand tighten the anchor bolts. Check the level and re-shim if necessary.
4. Tighten all anchor bolts in a star pattern in order to avoid distorting the pit cover.
5. If access to the bottom side is possible, carefully lower the pump and support plate onto the pit cover.
6. Install all bolts and hand tighten.
7. Check the level on the support plate and re-shim if necessary.
8. Tighten all bolts in a star pattern in order to avoid distorting the support plate.

For "Support plate installation without a pit cover":

1. Carefully lower the pump and support plate onto the foundation bolts.
2. Level the support plate in all directions using shims and wedges.
3. If you use the vapor-proof option, then perform one of these actions in order to make sure that you have an air-tight seal.
4. Hand tighten the anchor bolts. Check the level and re-shim if necessary.
5. Tighten all anchor bolts in a star pattern in order to avoid distorting the support plate.

Total main steps for Context2: 8 (with a pit cover) + 5 (without a pit cover) = 13

Answer: The "Support plate installation" procedure (Context2) has more steps than the "Inspect the pump" procedure (Context1).
