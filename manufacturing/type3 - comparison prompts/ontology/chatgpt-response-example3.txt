To determine which procedure has more steps, we need to count the main steps for each procedure without considering substeps or subtasks.

From Context1 (Support plate installation procedure):

    Main Procedure: :SupportPlateInstallation

        Sub-Procedure 1: :WithPitCover has the following steps:
            :LowerPitCover
            :LevelPitCover
            :HandTightenAnchorBolts1
            :CheckLevelReShim1
            :TightenBoltsStarPattern1
            :LowerPumpSupportPlate
            :InstallAllBolts
            :CheckLevelSupportPlate
            :TightenAllBoltsStarPattern

        Sub-Procedure 2: :WithoutPitCover has the following steps:
            :LowerPumpSupportPlate2
            :LevelSupportPlate2
            :EnsureAirTightSeal
            :HandTightenAnchorBolts2
            :CheckLevelReShim2
            :TightenBoltsStarPattern2

From Context2 (Shaft-seal maintenance procedure):

    Main Procedure: "Shaft-seal maintenance"
        Sub-Procedure: "Removal and installation of Mechanical seal" has the following steps:
            Lock out the driver power and remove the coupling guard.
            Drain oil from Bearing Frame (228).
            Remove the Coupling spacer and pump half hub (233) and key.
            Remove Socket head screws (268), Lockwasher (437B) and EZ adjust shaft nut (283A) from shaft.
