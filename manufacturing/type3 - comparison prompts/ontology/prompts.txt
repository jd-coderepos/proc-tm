Example 1: Inspect the pump vs. Support plate installation procedure
--------------------------------------------------------------------
//the tests can be performed with generated graphs as well as with gold-standard graph

EXAMPLE 1 PROMPT

Refer to the following RDF graph as Context1.

#copy-paste the "Inspect the pump" RDF graph generated previously in template 1 of example1

Now refer to the following RDF graph as Context2.

#copy-paste the "Support plate installation" RDF graph generated previously in template 1 of example2

Given Context1 and Context2, respectively, and please provide an Answer to the Question below. 

Question: Given that the Context1 RDF graph refers to "Inspect the pump" procedure and the Context2 RDF graph refers to the "Support plate installation" procedure, which procedure has more steps, not including any substeps or subtasks for each main step?
Answer:
