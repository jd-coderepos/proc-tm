Based on the provided context, here's the detailed list of steps for the "Removal and installation of Mechanical seal" sub-procedure under the "Shaft-seal maintenance" procedure:

Removal and Installation of Mechanical Seal:

1. Lock out the driver power and remove the coupling guard.
2. Drain oil from the Bearing Frame (228).
3. Remove the Coupling spacer and pump half hub (233) and key.
4. Remove Socket head screws (268), Lockwasher (437B), and EZ adjust shaft nut (283A) from the shaft.
5. Loosen and remove the End cover Hex Cap screws (370W) and Bearing frame End cover (109) with Laby seal (332A).
6. Pull out the Bearing carrier assembly (741) and remove the bearing carrier key (178S) from the shaft. (Place the carrier assembly on a clean, flat surface. Wrap the carrier assembly in a clean towel to keep any dust or dirt from getting on the Angular Contact Bearings. It is very important to keep these bearings as clean as possible.)
7. Remove the Bearing frame (228) and mounting hardware (352D) from the motor support.
8. Remove and service the Mechanical seal.
9. After Service, reassemble in reverse order.

Please note that these steps are derived from the provided context and are specific to the Model API3171 pump with an oil-lubricated bearing frame.
