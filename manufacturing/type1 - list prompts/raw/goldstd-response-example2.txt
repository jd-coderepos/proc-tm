Support plate installation 

Install the support plate with a pit cover  If access to the bottom of the pit cover is not possible during the installation process, you must assemble and install the pump (without the motor), support plate, and pit cover as a unit. You must install the pit cover perfectly level in order to make sure that the pump remains straight up and down when installed. The vapor-proof option includes machined, gasketed fits between the support plate/pit cover and the pit cover/foundation. You must install these gaskets in order to ensure emissions performance. Bolt the pit cover to a metal sole plate with a machined surface in order to ensure an air tight seal. 

1.   Carefully lower the pit cover onto the foundation bolts. 
2.   Use as long a level as possible in order to level the pit cover in all directions with shims or wedges. 
3.   Hand tighten the anchor bolts. Check the level and re-shim if necessary. 
4.   Tighten all anchor bolts in a star pattern in order to avoid distorting the pit cover. 
5.   If access to the bottom side is possible, carefully lower the pump and support plate onto the pit cover. 
6.   Install all bolts and hand tighten. 
7.   Check the level on the support plate and re-shim if necessary. 
8.   Tighten all bolts in a star pattern in order to avoid distorting the support plate.
