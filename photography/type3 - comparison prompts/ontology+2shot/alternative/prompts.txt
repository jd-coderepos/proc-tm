GENERIC PROMPT

//1st example

This is a Task example. You are not required to perform the task. You are only required to understand the Task. The Task example is as follows.

Refer to the following RDF graph as Context1.

#copy-paste the "formatting the card" RDF graph generated previously in template 1 of example1

Now refer to the following RDF graph as Context2.

#copy-paste the "fully automatic shooting" RDF graph generated previously in template 1 of example2

Given Context1 and Context2, respectively, and please provide an Answer to the Question below. 

Question: Given that the Context1 RDF graph refers to "Formatting the Card" procedure and the Context2 RDF graph refers to the "Fully Automatic Shooting" procedure, which procedure has more steps, not including any substeps or subtasks for each main step?
Answer: 

To answer the question, we need to count the number of main steps in each procedure without considering the substeps or subtasks.

From Context1 (Formatting the Card Procedure):

1. Select [Format]
2. Format the card
3. For low-level formatting

Total main steps in Context1: 3

From Context2 (Fully Automatic Shooting Procedure):

1. Set the Mode Dial to <1>
2. Aim any AF point over the subject
3. Focus the subject
4. Take the picture

Total main steps in Context2: 4

Answer: The "Fully Automatic Shooting" procedure from Context2 has more main steps than the "Formatting the Card" procedure from Context1.

//2nd example

This is a Task example. You are not required to perform the task. You are only required to understand the Task. The Task example is as follows.

Refer to the following RDF graph as Context1.

#copy-paste the "formatting the card" RDF graph generated previously in template 1 of example1

Now refer to the following RDF graph as Context2.

#copy-paste the "registering the picture style" RDF graph generated previously in template 1 of example3

Given Context1 and Context2, respectively, and please provide an Answer to the Question below.

Question: Given that the Context1 RDF graph refers to "Formatting the Card" procedure and the Context2 RDF graph refers to the "Registering the Picture Style" procedure, which procedure has more steps, not including any substeps or subtasks for each main step?
Answer:

To answer the question, let's break down the number of main steps in each procedure:

Context1: "Formatting the Card" Procedure

1. Select [Format]
2. Format the card
3. For low-level formatting

Total main steps in Context1: 3

Context2: "Registering the Picture Style" Procedure

1. Select a base Picture Style
2. Adjust its parameters as desired
3. Register it under [User Def. 1], [User Def. 2], or [User Def. 3]
4. Set the parameter

Total main steps in Context2: 4

Answer: The "Registering the Picture Style" procedure (from Context2) has more main steps than the "Formatting the Card" procedure (from Context1).

Do you comprehend the Task? Please only answer “yes” if you do and “no” if you don’t.
