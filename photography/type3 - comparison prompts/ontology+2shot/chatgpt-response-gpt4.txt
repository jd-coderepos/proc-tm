To answer the question, we need to count the number of main steps in each procedure without considering the substeps or subtasks.

From Context1 (Fully Automatic Shooting Procedure):

1. Set the Mode Dial to <icon>
2. Aim any AF point over the subject.
3. Focus the subject
4. Take the picture

Total main steps in Context1: 4

From Context2 (Registering the Picture Style Procedure):

1. Select the Picture Style
2. Choose a user-defined option
3. Select the base Picture Style
4. Register the new Picture Style

Total main steps in Context2: 4

Answer: Both the "Fully Automatic Shooting" procedure from Context1 and the "Registering the Picture Style" procedure from Context2 have the same number of main steps, which is 4.
