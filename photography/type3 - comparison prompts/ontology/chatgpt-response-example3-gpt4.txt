To determine which procedure has more steps without considering substeps or subtasks, we need to count the main steps in each procedure:

Context1: "Fully Automatic Shooting" procedure

    Set the Mode Dial to <1>
    Aim any AF point over the subject
    Focus the subject
    Take the picture

Total main steps in Context1: 4

Context2: "Registering the Picture Style" procedure

    Select a base Picture Style
    Adjust its parameters as desired
    Register it under [User Def. 1], [User Def. 2], or [User Def. 3]
    Set the parameter

Total main steps in Context2: 4

Answer: Both the "Fully Automatic Shooting" procedure and the "Registering the Picture Style" procedure have the same number of main steps, which is 4 steps each.
