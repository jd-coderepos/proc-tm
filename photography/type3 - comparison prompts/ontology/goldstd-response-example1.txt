To determine which procedure has more steps without considering any substeps or subtasks for each main step, we can count the main steps in each context.

Context1 ("Formatting the Card") has the following main steps:

Step1
Step2

Context2 ("Fully Automatic Shooting") has the following main steps:
Step1
Step2
Step3
Step4

Comparing the main steps:

Context1: 1 main step
Context2: 4 main steps
Therefore, the "Fully Automatic Shooting" procedure (Context2) has more main steps than the "Formatting the Card" procedure (Context1), not including any substeps or subtasks.
