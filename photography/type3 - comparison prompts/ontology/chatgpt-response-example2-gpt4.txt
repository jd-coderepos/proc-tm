To determine which procedure has more steps without considering substeps or subtasks, we need to count the main steps in each procedure.

From Context1 (Formatting the Card Procedure):

    ex:SelectFormatStep
    ex:FormatCardStep
    ex:LowLevelFormattingStep

Total main steps in Context1: 3

From Context2 (Registering the Picture Style Procedure):

    ex:SelectBasePictureStyle
    ex:AdjustParameters
    ex:RegisterUnderUserDef
    ex:SetParameter

Total main steps in Context2: 4

Comparing the two totals:

Context1 has 3 main steps.
Context2 has 4 main steps.

Answer: The "Registering the Picture Style" procedure (Context2) has more steps than the "Formatting the Card" procedure (Context1).
