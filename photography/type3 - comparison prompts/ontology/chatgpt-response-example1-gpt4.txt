To answer the question, we need to count the number of main steps in each procedure without considering the substeps or subtasks.

From Context1 (Formatting the Card Procedure):

1. ex:SelectFormatStep
2. ex:FormatCardStep
3. ex:LowLevelFormattingStep

Total steps in Context1: 3

From Context2 (Fully Automatic Shooting Procedure):

1. https://example.com/step/set-mode-dial
2. https://example.com/step/aim-af-point
3. https://example.com/step/focus-subject
4. https://example.com/step/take-picture
