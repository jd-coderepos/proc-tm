To answer the question, we need to count the number of main steps in each procedure without considering the substeps or subtasks.

From Context1 (Fully Automatic Shooting Procedure):

    Set the Mode Dial to <icon>
    Aim any AF point over the subject
    Focus the subject
    Take the picture

Total main steps in Context1: 4

From Context2 (Registering the Picture Style):

    Select the Picture Style
    Choose a user-defined option
    Select the base Picture Style
    Select a parameter to adjust
    Set the desired value for the parameter
    Register the new Picture Style

Total main steps in Context2: 6

Answer: The "Registering the Picture Style" procedure from Context2 has more main steps than the "Fully Automatic Shooting" procedure from Context1.
